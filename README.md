## About

**Stairs** is a game where you walk up stairs, step by step, until you give up...

## How To Run

The game is hosted [HERE](https://mehmetmhy.github.io/stairs/) through GitHub. But if you want to run it locally, download this code and navigate to it. Then just open the `index.html` file in your browser and start playing!

## Credits

This game was inspired by the video, [Games that Don't Fake the Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q85l1Fenc5w).

The main music in this game is from a YouTuber named [NyxVox](https://www.youtube.com/@NyxVox). Specially [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeyIAgXeIL0) video by **NyxVox**. The first 3 minutes and 26 seconds were used in this game. The final song in this game is from one of **Fear & Hunger** game's OST which I grabbed from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg3rsQ0yDRI) YouTube video. Massive credits goes to all of these creators.

## Practice

Stairs was built using the methodology of [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), meaning this code was entirely written using AI, where the human only made requests and handled version control, through [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the project. The code was mainly written by `Claude Sonnet 3.7` and `Gemini 2.5 Pro`, but parts of it were written/refined with o3, `gpt-4o`, and `gpt-4.1`. The game's icon was generated using OpenAI's `gpt-4o image model` with OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) web app. These models were utilized through Anthropic's [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) web app, the [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Cha](https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha/). The music was extracted from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) were [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) was used to download the audio and that audio was segmented/clipped using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
