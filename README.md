  <h1>Stairs</h1>
</div>

A game where you walk up stairs, step by step, until you give up...

Stairs was built using the methodology of [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), meaning this code was entirely built using AI, where the human only made requests and handled version control for the project.

This game was inspired by the video, [Games that Don't Fake the Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q85l1Fenc5w).
